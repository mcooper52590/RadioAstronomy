\smallskip
The digital revolution has changed many aspects of modern life.  Scientific instrumentation has been no exception.

\frametitle{Et Tu, Science? The Fall Analog.}
In the EOVSA array, the signal is digitized at the receiver, then sent to the control room.  Why?

\frametitle{Digital vs. Analog: A Phase Fight}
In analog systems, the gain to phase balance of a signal cannot be maintained to better than $1\%$ over a range of temperatures (Harris, 2005).\footnotemark

Nyquist Theorem
\begin{equation}
f_{crit} = \frac{f_{samp}}{2}
\end{equation}
In radio astronomy, to measure a 10 GHz signal, we would need to process 20 billion samples, or around 160 Gigabytes of data, a second.  Seem unreasonable? It is.
\column{0.5\textwidth}
Along with Nyquist, there is a limit to how much resolution there is between frequencies when using Fast Fourier Transform(FFT), which is given by 
\begin{equation}
f_{res} = f_{samp}/N
\end{equation}
where N is the number of sample points given to the FFT.
